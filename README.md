## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Postgres** (for database)
- **Stripe CLI** (for handling webhooks)

### Environment Variables

You'll need to set up the following environment variables for the application to run properly:

```bash
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://"
# For Stripe Test mode
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=""
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

You can set these in a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leerob/next-saas-starter
pnpm install
pnpm db:setup
pnpm db:seed
```

## Running Locally

Once you have set up the environment variables and installed dependencies, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then, also listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Testing Payments

To test Stripe payments, use the following test card details:

- Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiration: Any future date
- CVC: Any 3-digit number
